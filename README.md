# Full Stack Courses App

In this project I've created a REAST API and wrote a React frontend to manage my imaginary online school list of courses. 

This full stack App provides a way for a user to administrate database of courses. User can retrieve a list of courses, check detail of chosen course, create new courses, update or even delete courses that belongs to them.  

## Getting Started with Api

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

### Testing API
To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).<br>

To test and explore application use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) a popular application for testing REST APIs.


## Getting Started with Client

Install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Start the application.

```
npm start
```

and open in a browser http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
